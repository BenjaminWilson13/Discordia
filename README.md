## Overview


 * Here is a link to the live demo: https://discordia-dz4f.onrender.com/

 * This was a collaborative effort between 4 people: Beverly Duran, Jay Levin, Melinda Cortez, and Benjamin Wilson. 
 We had a relatively short amount of time to build out this project and worked closely together to make sure were staying on track. 

 * A few things we learned:
    * How to build out a backend API server using Python
    * Collaboration skills
    * Ways React allows multiple developers to divide up a project in to more manageable chunks. 

 * A few skills we improved upon: 
   * We greatly improved our skills with Redux in terms of building out a store and ensuring the reducers give new memory addresses to updated data.
